Okay, the user wants me to generate a README file for the '114. IoT Air Quality' project. Let's start by understanding the requirements. The project includes C/C++/Arduino code, so the README should be technical but clear. They specified a meaningful title under 50 characters. Maybe "IoT Air Quality Monitoring System with GPS Tracking" fits.

The detailed description should outline what the project does. It uses various sensors to monitor air quality parameters like CO, CO2, NH3, PM2.5, temperature, and humidity, along with GPS for location. The ESP32 is the microcontroller, and data is sent via GSM to a server. Need to mention the components and their purposes.

Next, they don't want contribution or license info, so I'll skip those sections. The user provided code snippets, which include pins for sensors. I should create a pin mapping table for clarity. From the code, the DHT11 is on pin 27, MQ7 on 39, MQ135s on 32 and 34, dust sensor on 36, LED on 13, GSM TX/RX on 19/18, GPS on 23/22. Need to list all those.

They also mentioned including a note about possible diagram inaccuracies. So after the pin map, add a disclaimer that the diagram is illustrative and might not match exact connections.

Looking at the code, there's an ESP32_AIR_IOT.ino and GSM_GPS_test.ino. Should structure the features based on the sensors and functionalities in the main code. Features include real-time monitoring, multi-sensor data collection, GPS tracking, GSM data transmission, and modular code.

In the detailed description, explain each sensor's role and how the data is transmitted. Also note the calibration factors in the code, which the user should adjust based on their sensors.

Make sure to mention the dependencies like libraries used: DHT, SoftwareSerial, TinyGPS++. Users need to install these before compiling.

The setup instructions can be brief since it's a README. Just list the hardware components, pin connections, and steps to upload the code. Also, calibrating sensors is important, so a note there.

The code overview should briefly explain the main ino file and the test file. Highlight the main functions like setup, loop, sensor readings, GPS checks, and server communication.

Finally, the note section should emphasize checking pin configurations and calibration. Ensure all sections are clear without unnecessary info. Avoid markdown formatting as per the request, but the user provided code snippets and expects the README in markdown. Since the user just wants the content, I'll structure it properly with headers and sections without extra explanations.
# IoT Air Quality Monitoring System with GPS Tracking

## Project Description  
This project implements an IoT-based air quality monitoring system using ESP32 microcontroller. It collects real-time environmental data including temperature, humidity, CO, CO₂, NH3, and PM2.5 levels while simultaneously tracking device location through GPS. Sensor data is transmitted to a remote server via GSM/GPRS for centralized monitoring. The system uses multiple MQ-series gas sensors combined with environmental compensation algorithms to provide actionable air quality insights.

## Key Features
- 6-in-1 environmental monitoring (Temp/Humidity/CO/CO₂/NH3/PM2.5)
- Real-time GPS geolocation tracking
- GSM-based cellular data transmission
- Calibration-adjusted sensor readings
- Serial monitoring interface
- LED status indication for particle detection
